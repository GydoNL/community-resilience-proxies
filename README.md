# measuring-resilience
Dataset that measures resilience of rural communities in Scotland

Looking for several proxies for measuring community resilience. Ideas I've got so far:

Variable important for resilience and their proxies
1) leadership -> ?
2) diverse economy -> ?
3) community infrastructure -> resilience indicator dataset

Community strengths present in rural Scotland researched qualitatively
1) values and beliefs
2) social networks
3) people place relationships
4) positive outlook -> if good place to live sufficiently indicates a positve outlook

Community strenghts not necessarily in rural Scotland and their potential proxies
1) engaged government -> ?
2) knowledge, community learning, skills  -> years of existence
