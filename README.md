# measuring-resilience
Dataset that measures resilience of rural communities in Scotland

Looking for several proxies for measuring community resilience. Ideas I've got so far:

1) infrastructure -> resilience indicator dataset
2) knowledge, community learning, skills  -> years of existence
3) diverse economy -> resilience indicators dataset, ?
4) leadership -> ?
5) positive outlook -> ?

Community strengths purposely left open:
1) engaged government
2) social networks
3) values and beliefs
4)people place relationships
